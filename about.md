Hello Wold ! üòÅ

I'm Adel Moumen, I'm French üá´üá∑ and I study AI since my first year at university as a self-taught learner.

I love learning and reading books ! 

In University, I'm currently in an honour program degree ([CMI](https://reseau-figure.fr/)) in Computer Science and I'm also involved into a 2 years program in [entrepreneurship](https://univ-avignon.fr/formations/orientation-et-insertion/l-entrepreneuriat-etudiant/l-entrepreneuriat-etudiant-15387.kjsp) at [Avignon University](https://ceri.univ-avignon.fr/formations/cursus-master-ingenierie-en-informatique/). 

In AI, I try to build a deep comprehension of this domain especially in Deep Learning. 
I only do machine learning applications that are in the scope of "AI for social good" and that are not too heavy if they are not useful for the community because üåç matter. 

I have already done 2 internships in AI, my first one was in a company named E-magina where I did a lot of different tasks as a Data Scientist (Data Extraction, Data Cleaning, Data visualization, neural networks, system multi-agents...) in the context of the construction of a French combat sports directories during 1 month in 2020.

 My last one was at Laboratoire Informatique d'Avignon ([LIA](https://lia.univ-avignon.fr/)) under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof Titouan Parcollet](http://www.darnault-parcollet.fr/Parcollet/) during +2 month in 2021. During this internship I have investigates different ways of making [LiGRU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.10225.pdf) a mandatory alternative to LSTM/GRU for speech processing. The LiGRU suffer from a poor GPU implementation and an instability in the recurrent connection. This internship has involved to build a benchmark platform, investigates differents ways to solve this problem (Custom Op PyTorch, TorchScript, Custom Kernel...), defined the backpropagation equations and implement them in PyTorch Autograd and a custom kernel with Numba. The work that I did will be implemented into [SpeechBrain](https://speechbrain.github.io/) an open-source and all-in-one speech toolkit, designed to be simple, extremely flexible, and user-friendly. This toolkit offer a competitive and state-of-the-art performance in various domains. 

This blog aim's to provide some articles on my passion that will be written in English and French.
