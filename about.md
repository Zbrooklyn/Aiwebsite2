My name is Grant Amann.

I am a senior at USC studying Urban Studies and Planning. I love Argentina, Spanish, WebDev, and being a member of the Church of Jesus Christ.

This website is meant to be a collection of thoughts, not everything on it is true, and I don't believe everything I write. My thoughts change a lot, but I'm trying to find truth.
