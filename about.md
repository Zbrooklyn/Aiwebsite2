Hello there, I'm a 21 year old fullstack(React + Java) software developer at HashedIn by Deloitte. I've always been passionate about cybersecurity ever since I first read about a zip bomb on an obscure blog post back in 2015.It fascinates me of the innumerable ways one can break something that someone has so carefully created and run through multiple layers of testing(not done in most cases). I love learning about binary exploitation, pwning and breaking into websites, although I've not had much luck in them with real world scenarios. I also dabble in CTF's as and when I get the time. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to team up! :)
