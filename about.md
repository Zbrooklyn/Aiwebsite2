Hello Wold ! 😁

I'm Adel Moumen, I'm French 🇫🇷 and I study AI since my first year at university as a self-taught learner. 

In University, I'm currently in an honour program degree in computer science and I'm also involved into a 2 years program in entrepreneuriat. 

In AI, I try to build a deep comprehension of this domain especially in Deep Learning. I only do machine learning applications that are in the scope of "AI for social good" and that are not too heavy if they are not usefull for the community because 🌍 matter. 

This blog aim's to provide some articles on my passion.
