Hello, my name is Gyan Lakhwani. I am a designer and a nerd, and this website is a place for me to document my thoughts and try out experiments with code. If you find something broken, please tweet at me [@gyanl](https://twitter.com/gyanl).

#### Tech Stack
This website is a Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub Pages. I wrote a custom CSS theme that has dark and light mode support, as well as nice typography. There is some documentation in my [GitHub](https://github.com/gyanl/gyanl.github.io) if you want to try using this theme.
