Hello there, I'm a 22 year old fullstack(React + Java) software developer at HashedIn by Deloitte. I've always been passionate about cybersecurity ever since I first read about a zip bomb on an obscure blog post back in 2015. What fascinates me the most, are the innumerable ways one can break something that someone has so carefully created and run through multiple layers of testing, with such Picasso-ish finesse that it almost seems like a joke. I love learning about binary exploitation, pwning and breaking into websites (and making them as it's my primary profession), although I've not had much luck in them with real world scenarios. I also dabble in CTF's as and when I get the time. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to team up and play some CTFs! :)
