### Go through research work conducted by the faculty

You can find a list of all faculty in IDC [here](http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/people/faculty). The current faculty in the interaction design department are:

-   Anirudha Joshi
-   Girish Dalvi
-   Jayesh Pillai
-   Pramod Khambete
-   Ravi Poovaiah
-   Swati Pal
-   Venkatesh Rajamanickam
-   Vivek Kant

As the M.Des. program is a master's level course, you will be expected to not only learn things but also contribute to the existing pool of knowledge in the world. Being familiar with the work the faculty have done will show them that you tried to engage with the research projects at IDC, and should also give you a sense of the kind of work that gets done at the institute.
