>What you need to know to pass the exam.

## Experiment Design  
An experiment is conducted to find the effect of one variable on another.

For eg.  
- The number of hours of sleep the night before an exam, and the marks scored.  
- Two different designs of a chair, and the average response on a scale of 1 to 10 when 5 people were asked to rank comfort.

### Independent variable
The variable we can control. Eg.hours of sleep.

### Dependent Variable
The variable that varies because we changed the independent variable. Eg. marks in test.
