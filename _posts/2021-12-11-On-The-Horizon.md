Ideas and motivation behind my new project! <!--more-->

If you're actively applying for jobs or reading about people's experiences you'd have often come across this term `potfolio`, being bandied around like hot cakes. What is it? Well it's nothing but a good collection (it can just be one marvelous thing, no need for plural :)) of your work. In the tech world, I'd prefer to call it a "showcase" rather than a portfolio - because it's a representation of your skills - albeit it's not the entire picture, heck it barely scratches the surface , but let's be honest - you're way more inclined to believe me if I showed you that I could beat Eliud Kipchoge in a marathon ([here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliud_Kipchoge) who he is by the way) by actually doing it, rather than just _running_ my mouth off, right?
