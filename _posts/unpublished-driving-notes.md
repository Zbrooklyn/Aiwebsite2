This document details the pointers for behind-the-wheel driving test.


What to check before starting
- Parking brake
- Turn signals
- Windshield wipers - various wiping speed
- Defroster
- Hazard lights
- Headlights - off, on, high beam


All turns at traffic juntions should be around 12-15 mph.


Traffic junction
- Protected left turn (with turning traffic lights)
    - Signal
    - Check slip lane if turning to rightmost lane
    - Follow guiding markers if there is
- Unprotected left turn (without turning traffic lights)
    - At green light, move forward to establish position
    - At yellow light, check if incoming cars are slowing down
    - Make the turn
    - (Can you turn when there are no incoming cars on green?)
    - (Can you do this turn only on yellow?)
- (with left turning lane)
    - Follow lane change procedure first
- Right turn with slip lane
    - Signal
    - Slide to right (check back and shoulder)
    - Check for straight traffic, left-turning traffic, U-turning traffic

    - Check for pedestrians
    - Turn at 15 mph

        - Otherwise, stop and wait
- (with left turning lane)

Procedures
- Starting
- Lane change
    - Check for opportunity
    - Signal
    - Check back mirror
    - Check side mirror
    - Shoulder check
    - Change lane
- Stopping
    - Stop accelerating when you see the stop signal
    - Decelerate smoothly (I would apply a constant brake)
    - Release break slightly when speed approaches zero
- Reversing
    - Stop
    - Change gear to reverse
    - (TBC)


General procedures
- Check for opportunity
- Signal

General rules

- Stop sign means stop, red light means stop
- When it is your turn to go, you need to go


General tips at this stage
- I do not care about fuel efficiency for now, but still care correleating necessary objectives.
- I want to check only the necessary places for now.
- There is no need to think of extraordinary scenarios for now - like someone running the red light.
