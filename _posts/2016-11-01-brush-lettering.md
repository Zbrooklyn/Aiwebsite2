### About the project
I started this project for Inktober 2016. I'd been learning brush lettering for a while, and I painted a series of pop-culture phrases from things that I love. They're mostly watercolor on paper, with some digital processing to clean up blemishes. Here are a few of my favorites.

> Hello World. As an engineering student turned into a designer, it only seemed fitting to start with this.


> Don't even trip, dawg. From Rick and Morty, one of my all-time favorite TV shows.


> Time to get schwifty! Also from Rick and Morty.


> This one's from the IT Crowd, another favorite.


> Community! #sixseasonsandamovie


> Picture yourself in a boat on a river. From Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, by The Beatles.
