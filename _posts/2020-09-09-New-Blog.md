This is my new blog. Im doing lots of new projects, and I needed a space to collect them.  

I also listened to a talk this morning that heeded me to keep a record of this weird COVID time.

So that's this.

### Righteous Desire vs God's Will

Brenna emailed me this question. Holy smokes its a good one:
```html
I forgot to put this in my voice recording but I wanted to ask you a question. So the other day I was reading the story of the brother of Jared. I'm always amazed by his faith. Anyway this is my question: what is the balance between having faith and asking the Lord for what you righteously desire without interrupting His will? I just struggle with feeling guilty sometimes for asking the Lord for help/my desires because I'm worried that's forcing my will upon His. For example, the brother of Jared straight up tells God like I know you can make these stones have light so do it (Ether 3:4-5). The brother of Jared says what he wants and then God actually does it. At what point is it not okay to ask God to do certain things. 
Idk if this makes any sense but it's been on my mind. If I need to explain more I'll send you more about it next week```
