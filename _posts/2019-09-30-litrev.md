#### [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
The world's largest search engine brings you the world's largest academic search engine. It has pretty good coverage, and you can directly copy the citation for a result. Good place to start searching for papers.

#### [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/)
Unpaywall is a Chrome extension that shows you a little green lock when there's a legal open-access of a paper you're trying to find available for download.

#### [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)
Pronounced as "archive" because the X represents the Greek letter chi. It is an open access website for uploading e-prints of papers. The papers aren't necessarily peer reviewed, but a lot of the published papers in the core sciences end up here.
