This is a retired Linux box in the Easy category.<!--more-->

As with any HTB machine I downloaded the connection pack, fired up openvpn with `ovpn wazza.ovpn` and established my TCP connection to the HTB VPN.
 Next, I started out with service discovery using nmap with
 ```
 nmap -T4 -p0-65535 -A 10.10.10.3 -Pn
 ``` 
 Damn, this is taking too long. Let me edit the switches
 ```
 nmap -sV -O -F --version-light 10.10.10.3
 ```

Interesting, there seem to be a few services running. Let's try to target vsftpd first. On googling the service with the version in use, I see there is an RCE on Rapid7 [here](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor/) - so that means there is a Metasploit module for that. Great, let's fire up msfconsole and get to work!

`set RHOSTS 10.10.10.3` basically sets the local IP of the HTB machine you're targeting. Note that it may change when you fire up an instance. Now that all the options have been set, let's exploit it!

Dang, looks like I need some credentials to access it. Let's try looking into the `samba` service that's running on port 139. Googling samba and the version for some vulnerabilities, I stumbled upon this [map script code execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16320). I'm quite sure there is a metasploit module for that - sure enough, there is. Let's list the options for it with `show options`:

Let's set the options, pretty standard stuff:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/assets/Lame/msf5.png" alt="Thumbnail"/></div><br/>

Looks like we're all good to go, let's exploit it!

Boom! [happy hacker noises] We're in. That too as root straight away (well, I did say it was an Easy box).
Now you simply need to navigate to the home folder, locate `user.txt` and `cat` it. Same for `root.txt`. Here's a quick hint:

```
locate root.txt
```
That should easen the pain of hunting for the files, atleast in an Easy level box. Well that's that for Lame - submit root and user flags to totally OWN the box. Now, there are tons of other ways in which people have solved Lame, this article is just ONE of the ways in which to do it. Until next time hombre! :)
