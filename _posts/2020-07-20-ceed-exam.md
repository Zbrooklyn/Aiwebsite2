I have had a number of people reach out to me to ask about the CEED exam, and if I have any tips. I am collecting this information here.

### Go through previous year papers
The CEED website will have an archive of old question papers. While there is no "syllabus" that is provided, you can reverse engineer the sort of things they ask by looking through the papers and finding common patterns. Start going through the papers beginning from the most recent years, and note down the topics the questions touch upon. If you don't know the answer to a question, read about it and related topics online.

### Practice drawing
I'm not great at sketching, so this was one of the areas I had to work on. For the interaction design program, your drawing is not expected to be greatâ€”just good enough to get an idea across. Nevertheless, you should be able to quickly sketch a person in an environment performing an activity. There are a lot of figure sketching and perspective drawing tutorials on Youtube that can help with this.
