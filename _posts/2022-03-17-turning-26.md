## Turning 26 (2022)

This year was a better year than the last one. Some of uncertainity has given way to accepting that this is just the way the world is now.

#### Highlights of the year
- Got vaccinated. Whew. 
- Moved out to a tiny apartment and lived by myself for a while. I moved out and then moved back home. 
- Bought a pair of Skechers, which changed my life. So comfortable!
- Took a week off to travel to Shimla with my mom, brother and grandparents. Stayed an extra week and worked from the mountains.
- Went to Pune for Gauri's wedding. Met all my IDC friends for the graduation farewell we never had. 


- Decided that I didn't want to be talking to my father anymore. 

#### Things I want to do at 26
- Move out of Delhi


This was Gyan in 2020-21. Here's to being 25!
