## Turning 26 (2022)

This year was a better year than the last one. Some of uncertainity has given way to accepting that this is just the way the world is now.

### Highlights of the year

#### Getting vaccinated
Getting an appointment was a bit of a challenge in the early days of vaccine availablity, but getting the actual shots felt a little bit anti-climacticâ€”I think I expected it to be a huge milestone after which things would suddenly get better, but life felt pretty much the same. I had a day of fever after the first shot, but the second one was pretty mild. I haven't gotten COVID yet, and I'm hoping to keep it that way. Hooray for modern medicine.

#### Moving out
Moved out to a tiny apartment and lived by myself for a while. I moved out and then moved back home.

###### This is what living in my office and working in my bedroom looked like most of the time

###### I built a makeshift bookshelf with cardboard and tape

#### Buying better shoes
I wanted to do more running and decided to invest in a pair of Skechers. I haven't ended up doing much running, but I wear the Skechers everywhere now. They're so comfortable!

#### Trip to Shimla 
Took a week off to travel to Shimla with my mom, brother and grandparents. Stayed an extra week and worked from the mountains.

#### Gauri's wedding in Pune
Went to Pune for Gauri's wedding. Met all my IDC friends for the graduation farewell we never had.

#### Goa with friends
I've travelled with friends before or to visit friends before, but that has always involved some kind of work. This was my first vacation with friends, and it was nice to be able to spend a week eating seafood, getting drunk, and watching the sunsets on the beach.

###### Another beach stock photo, but this time it's me with a shirt I bought at a beach shack

#### Journalling
I bought a Muji notebook on a whim and decided I needed to do *something* with it, and started journalling. I make it a point to write down what feel like the major things happening in my life. I enjoy the act of putting ink on paper, and if nothing else this becomes an excuse to use my fountain pen now and then.

### Things I want to do at 26
- Move out of Delhi
- Learn to play the keyboard
- Take pottery or sculpture classes
- Find more time to do things I enjoy
- Be stricter about not letting work bleed into personal time
