These are my notes from PS:626 AI, Data & Policy, an elective offered by Prof. Anupam Guha of the Centre for Policy Studies at IIT Bombay.

### Why did I take this elective?
The fourth and last semester of the IDC M.Des. program has a research project and a design project, but no lectures. Masters students at IIT, however, can choose to take one of a [set of electives](http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/Instituteelectivelist2019.pdf). I thought it would be interesting to make the most of being a design school in IIT Bombay, and take a course offerred by another department. I took the AI, Data and Policy partly because I follow [Prof. Guha on Twitter](https://twitter.com/anupam_guha) and I happened to see his tweet about the course, and partly because my internship at Microsoft in Summer 2019 involved working with AI, and I felt a little crippled by my inability to actually prototype anything as a designer.
