## Turning 25 (2021)
This has been a weird year. I find myself feeling a little bit melancholic, as I often do on birthdays.

## Turning 24 (2020)
I didn't write anything in 2020 because the IIT Bombay campus unexpectedly shut down due to COVID-19, and I took a flight back home the next morning. Here are some pictures from that day though.

Last year and the year before that I wrote a note to myself on my birthday. Here's some stuff on how it was being 22 and some things I want to do at 23.

Last year's note was me talking about how it had been a slow year and how not much had happened. Being 22 was a whirlwind. I moved to Mumbai to study design at IDC, which has changed how I think about things a lot. I lived away from my family for the first time and said some really hard goodbyes, and spent a lot of time feeling sad and confused. But I made a bunch of new friends, and worked really hard, harder than I ever had before, and decided to just get shit done and try to be a better person myself.
Each year on my birthday I expect some sort of grand gestures from people I love, and it never quite happens the way I want it to and I feel miserable and make people miserable because they didn't get it right. This year I decided to skip the drama and plan things out myself, and had a pretty nice weekend with friends and family.

#### Highlights of the year
- Went on a road trip to Leh and Ladakh, and a college field trip to Daman 
- Making new friends at IDC - love you guys! (Watching @niharika.kapil constantly fail at simple things like opening a juice box has brought me joy many, many times) 
- The chairness of chairs 
- Chai and vada pao 
- Running around in circles (shoutout to IXDRC) 
- Got an internship at Microsoft Hyderabad and I'll be there for 2 months in the summer 

#### Things I want to do at 23
- Travel - Take that clich√© college Goa trip and go for Biennale 
- Live healthier (Run more, eat better, sleep enough (lol)) 
- Write more (fix my website + blog) 
- Do fun things with code? Make a font? Idk

This was Gyan in 2018-19. Here's to being 23!

## Turning 22 (2018)

Last year I wrote a note to myself on my 21st birthday and I guess this is a thing now. These are some notes on how it was being 21 and some things I want to do at 22.

This was not an exciting year. It was slow, and while things moved in mostly the right direction they were not as fast as I would have liked. I had to remind myself that it's okay to take my time to get where I want, and it's okay to take my time to decide where I want to be.

I worked hard this year and it paid off. I am proud of the work I did and where it got me, and I'm glad to finally be in a space where I'm certain that I can do design full time. College will end soon and it feels like the slow ascent to the apex of a rollercoaster ride. Everything will change completely very soon and that's both exciting and scary.

I have spent a lot of time by myself and have felt lonely a lot, but I spent today with people I love and I think I should do that more. I might be moving to Bangalore in a few months and and I will miss my friends and family. Note to self : if you start sitting in your room feeling sorry for yourself you should get out for a while and do something.

I now get taken very seriously by a lot of people and that sometimes that surprises me. I have finally started to feel like an adult, but sometimes I also feel like two children in a trenchcoat masquerading as one.

### Highlights of the year

- Shirin! Thank you for pyaar and dosti and your beautiful face. (@lonefoxdancing)
- I won IIIT Delhi's design hackathon... both times it happened this year.
- I finally learned to drive and now have a driver's license.
- I traveled to Shimla, Mcleodganj, Goa and Bangalore.
- I cleared the NID entrance and got India rank 9 for information design and rank 13 for interaction design. It's the first time I've done well on a test in a while and it feels good.
- I got a job offer from Flipkart.

### Things I hope to do next year
- Travel more
- Learn new things both in my field and outside of it
- Meet new people and make friends and be less of a curmudgeon

This was Gyan in 2017-18. Here's to being 22!

## Turning 21 (2017)

I've been thinking about being 20. It started terribly. On my first day of being 20, I already had a broken heart I thought would never heal. I didn't know what I was doing with myself as an engineering student trying to do design.

But things got better. I did a bunch of travelling. I made new friends. I learnt new things. I figured out a plan for my life. I worked on some cool projects with some cool people. In retrospect, it's been a pretty good year. Here's to hoping 21 is great too.
