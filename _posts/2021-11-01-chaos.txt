I was reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, and one of the concepts the author mentions caught my attention. According to Harari, there are two main classifications of chaos.

#### First Order Chaos
This is a chaotic phenomenon that doesn’t respond to prediction.
For eg. The weather is a chaotic system because of the huge number of variables involves, but it can be predicted to some level of accuracy. The weather does not change based on the prediction.

#### Second Order Chaos 
A chaotic phenomenon that is not predictable because it responds to prediction. Examples include things like stocks and politics—if someone predicts that a certain stock will rise 20% tomorrow, then people will react to the prediction, possibly causing demand and hence the price to go up today, hence making the prediction incorrect. 

Second order chaos is, in a sense, the opposite of a self fulfiling prophecy. By making a prediction, people will react to the prediction and make it not come true.
