You are a designer. Or perhaps you want to be one, and right now you will settle for just ~~making coffee~~ being a valueable, respected member of the workforce as an intern. You are now wondering you can make this happen. Well, you've come to the right place. I have a particular penchant for being an intern. I made coffee at a small (now defunct) startup called Surgge, I made coffee at a larger startup called Zomato (still going strong) and last year I even made coffee at a very big startup called Microsoft (I hear they too are doing well).

###### The coffee machine gleams in the sunlight, just like everything else in your office. It is calling out to you. "Drink some more coffee," it says. “It’ll make your brain go faster.”

I miss getting up from my desk and walking over to the coffee booth at work to make myself some coffee.

But, I digress. I have barely left my house in the past three months, and I fear I am becoming a fixture. I don't have the energy, or motivation to fight what seems inevitable—I will become plain. I will melt into the background, and nobody will notice.
