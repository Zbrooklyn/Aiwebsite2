# Lesson 1 Notes

## Lecture
- This course is about the valuation of assets.

- Is valuation an art or a science?
  - In a science if you get the i/p right, you get the o/p right. valuation is not a science.
  - Within art, there are learnable elements but you need to have an innate ability for the same.
  - Valuation is a craft, *you learn by doing*. The more you do it, the better you get at it.

- 5 broad themes of the class :
  - Valuation is a craft.
  - Valuation is simple & universal. [ Start with mature publicly traded companies, and then across the life cycle, startups, private businesses, then individual assets, differences in valuation and pricing.]
  - Two different ways of putting a number on an assets, you can value the asset or you can price it. Value comes from cashflow, growth and risks. Price is driven by demand and supply, market moods etc. When you put a number on an asset, you need to ask if you are valuing it or pricing it. [How to price things better?]

  [Q : Are you a number cruncher or a storyteller? I am a number cruncher.]
  - A Valuation is both about numbers and stories. Good valuation connects stories to numbers. Every number has to have a story attached and every story has to have a number backing it up.
  - If you are valuing something, you should be willing to act on it. You need to have faith in your valuation.
