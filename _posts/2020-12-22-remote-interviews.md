Setting the stage

### Keep video on
Participants joining the call from their homes may be hesitant to share their video from their home environment or due to bandwidth concerns. Make sure you turn on your video so that participants can see who they are talking to, and let them know that you are also working from home and there may be some background noises. Doing an interview through a screen makes it harder to read non-verbal cues, so you should set an example that this is an informal chat and encourage participants to turn on their video if they are comfortable.


### Keep it informal


### Avoid leading questions


### Ask open ended questions instead of yes/no

### Listen!
Many researchers will feel the need to fill in gaps in the conversation. Sometimes allowing for a pause in the conversation will give participants a moment to reflect, and they will be able to say something else. Don't leave an awkward gap in the conversation, but employ active listening techniques ()
