### What is Circos?

### Who is it for?

### How can I use Circos?
Circos Words that describe the Circos install page.


## Some key data
Now that we know what Circos can do, let's try and use it!

### Formatting the data
Circos uses :  
- A matrix of data
- With headers for both rows and coloumns
- Formatted as tab separated values

### Putting tables into Circos

But wait! Circos can't technically represent tables, it can represent *matrices.* What's the difference? In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, whereas a table can have any kinds of values.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
