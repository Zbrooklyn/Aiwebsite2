January 2020 started with news articles massive bush fires that had been raging in Australia. I remember looking at photos and the word 'apocalyptic' came to mind. If you're the sort of person who believes in omens, this looked like one.

Closer to home, there were protests against the Citizenship Amendment Bill (which later became the Citizenship Amendment Act) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). There were protests across India, including at Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi where police forcibly entered the campus and used batons and tear gas on students.[^1] This act of police brutality lead to further protests across universities in India, including the IIT Bombay campus. I read the news each day with a deepening sense of discomfort about the direction things were going in, and felt angry and powerless like many other people at the time. I was trying to find a direction for my final semester research and design projects, but felt like I couldn't just ignore what was happening around me.

Still, I started 2020 feeling like I was in a good place. I had spent a year and a half studying interaction design at IDC School of Design, and I had made a lot of friends and learned about 12 different answers to the question ‘What is design?’ (every professor had a different answer). Every now and then, someone would remark that it was the last time we were doing something—the last time we had a lecture in the Interaction Design studio, the last time we were giving an exam. The final semester had a lot of lasts, and I was starting to be painfully aware that my time at IDC was coming to an end.
