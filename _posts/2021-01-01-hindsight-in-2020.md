I started 2020 feeling like I was in a good place. I had spent a year and a half studying interaction design at IDC School of Design, and I had made a lot of friends and learned about 12 different answers to the question ‘What is design?’ (every professor had a different answer). Every now and then, someone would remark that it was the last time we were doing something—the last time we had a lecture in the Interaction Design studio, the last time we were giving an exam. The final semester had a lot of lasts, and I was starting to be painfully aware that my time at IDC was coming to an end. 

In January 2020, I saw news articles about massive bush fires that had been raging in Australia. I remember looking at photos and the word 'apocalyptic' came to mind.
