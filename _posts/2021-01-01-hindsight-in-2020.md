January 2020 started with news articles massive bush fires that had been raging in Australia. I remember looking at photos and the word 'apocalyptic' came to mind. If you're the sort of person who believes in omens, this looked like one. Things mostly just went downhill from there. We had protests about the CAA/NRC at the beginning of the year, a pandemic in March, locust attacks in June, riots in the US, and the word *unprecedented* being thrown around all the time. Still, we got through the year, vaccines were developed, people persevered, and we're now in 2021 where I'm really, really hoping things will start getting better. 

## Things that happened this year

1. The IIT Bombay campus was shut down in mid-March and I came back to Delhi with just some clothes and my laptop, expecting that campus would reopen in a few weeks. ![Two people in a room](https://gyanl.com/assets/room-c703.jpg)

2. I graduated from the Interaction Design program at IDC School of Design in June. My finishing my final semester design project while working from home. I worked on a concept for crowdsourced reporting and factchecking for misinformation on social media (especially WhatsApp) after looking at just how much fake news and propaganda was spreading through the internet about CAA/NRC, COVID-19 and other issues.
2. I started a job as a UX Designer at Microsoft working on Voice UX.
