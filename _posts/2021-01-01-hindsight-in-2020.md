January 2020 started with news articles massive bush fires that had been raging in Australia. I remember looking at photos and the word 'apocalyptic' came to mind. If you're the sort of person who believes in omens, this looked like one. Things mostly just went downhill from there. We had protests about the CAA/NRC at the beginning of the year, a pandemic in March, locust attacks in June, riots in the US, and the word *unprecedented* being thrown around all the time. Still, we got through the year, vaccines were developed, people persevered, and we're now in 2021 where I'm really, really hoping things will start getting better. 

## Things that happened in 2020

#### Starting the year
I started my final semester in January trying to pick a final semester project, and preparing myself for the end of my two years at IDC. I had learned a lot, made some great friends, and learned about 12 different answers to the question “What is design?”. 

It was a bittersweet time, and I was preparing myself for a series of lasts. The last group project. The last all nighter in the Interaction Design studio. The last midnight walk on campus.

#### Moving back to Delhi
The IIT Bombay campus was shut down in mid-March and I came back to Delhi with just some clothes and my laptop, expecting that campus would reopen in a few weeks. It didn't, and I got my life's belongings shipped to me in a cardboard box a few months later. I had been away from home for a year and a half, and it took some time to get used to living at home again. However, I've been grateful to have my family around me this year.

#### Graduating from college (remotely)
I graduated from the Interaction Design program at IDC School of Design in June. My final semester project was a concept for crowdsourced reporting and factchecking tool for misinformation on social media (especially WhatsApp) after looking at just how much fake news and propaganda was spreading through the internet about CAA/NRC, COVID-19 and other issues.

#### Starting a new job
I started a job as a UX Designer at Microsoft working on Voice experiences for mobile devices.

It has been an interesting experience to design for voice—patterns for visual design in apps are quite well defined, but voice interactions are newer, and user expectations are more amorphous. So far I have worked on Read Aloud, a text-to-speech feature for Word and transcription in Office.

#### Whiteboard.fm Podcast feature
I was featured on the Whiteboard.fm podcast, talking about starting out in design as a engineering student, finding freelance projects, studying design at IDC and more.

## Things I hope to do in 2021
I spent most of 2020 feeling like the future was entirely out of control, and I didn't try to be very ambitious with my plans for the year.
