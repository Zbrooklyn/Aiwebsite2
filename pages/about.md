### Long

I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia. A son and elder brother born in an Indonesian Chinese family. My mom and sister are like cats and dogs. My dad thinks my younger sister at the age where she should get married (not yet married). 

I was in Jakarta when there were mass demonstrations from the local Indonesian resident. We had to throw out our cash money to the people who came barging to our car. That event led me to attend Desert Vista high school in Phoenix, Arizona, which I graduated with honors. There I witnessed the World Trade Center incident and the news spread out so quickly that past lunch period classes were dismissed. After going through another life's difficulty, I attended Tarumanagara University and received my Bachelor of design degree with honors. I went to Beijing Language and Culture Center to learn Chinese. I am afraid for the past 20 so years I am unable to say that I am Indonesian Chinese. I am currently working and residing in Shanghai, China. 

My previous work was at Google and we were stationed at one of the Google office in Beijing. The department we worked for was Google maps. My work focus was on debugging, answering technical questions, and providing workarounds or solutions to software/hardware bugs. I am knowledgable in SQL, HTML, and now trying to learn some basic software engineering.
