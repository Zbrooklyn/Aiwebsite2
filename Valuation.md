One skill I've always wanted to pick up on has been Valuation. Now this could be the valuation of businesses, cryptocurrencies, assets or going a little bit far fetched, people. This year in 2019, I've decided to take the Valuation course by [Aswath Damodaran](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/). He offers the same course to both Undergrads and MBA students, I don't think I will find better resources for the same. I aim to write notes for the class under this tab, also trying to do assignments and other challenges given in the class.
