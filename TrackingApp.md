<h2>Which kind of apps are used for intimate partner violence(IPV)?</h2>

- <strong>Spy applications</strong>
- <strong>Location tracking applications</strong>

While some application are malicious, others are designed to make our life easier by sharing the location of our loved ones. However, these are normally abused during IPV<br>

The <strong>spy app</strong> belongs the first category. These type of applications are designed to track the user while exposing their private information to others. The "spy" nature of this kind of application make the spying activity hard to trace.

The second category of application used in IPV is typical misused <strong>location sharing apps</strong>. since their initial design purpose is to serve us. For example, the finding device or anti-theft (Find-my-phone) apps or system function(Find my iPhone) can also be misused for their locating features. When the abuser have access to these apps, they can monitor the victim in a very hidden and distanted way, especially these apps generally can't be disabled unless the victim aware of. Additionally, some system apps can’t be uninstalled or disabled for security reasons and the user can’t block this system calls/notification.<br>

Another typical catagory of application is the misused security application, like the Children safety app or other patient moniter app.  For these apps, they are designed can’t be removed by the user under surveillance. Which means, even the victim find out they are monitered, they can't get rid of it by themselves.
