<h2>Which kind of apps are used for IPV?</h2>

Some application design to be malicious, while other applications are misused, or abused by their features which are designed to make our lives secure.
<br></br>
The spy app belongs the first catagoray. These type of applications is designed for tracking the user, expose the privacy to others. While it is dangerous, it is relatively not easy to find or install.
<br></br>
The second type of application is typical misused apps, since their inital design purpose is to serve us. For example, the finding device or anti-theft (Find-my-phone) apps or system function(Find my iPhone) can also be misused for their locating features. When the abuser have access to these apps, they can monite the victim in a very hidden and distanted way, especially these apps generally can't be disabled unless the victim aware of. Additionally, some system apps can’t be uninstalled or disabled for security reasons and the user can’t block this system calls/notification.
<br></br>
Another typical catagory of application is the misused security application, like the Children safety app or other patient moniter app.  For these apps, they are designed can’t be removed by the user under surveillance. Which means, even the victim find out they are monitered, they can't get rid of it by themselves.
